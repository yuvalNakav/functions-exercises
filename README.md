# Functions Exercises

[### I solved the bonus]: <>

## Before you begin

- Fork and clone this repo to your computer
- Open vs-code. In the terminal `ctrl + j` type `npm i` and press enter
- Add a file named `.gitignore` and type in this: `node_modules`
- Now the `node_modules` folder should be greyd out

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

You are ready to begin!

<br/>

Write your code in the file `Exercise.js` in the pre-made functions.

- **Commit** after each question you solve
- **Do not** change any function's name
- **Do not** delete any other piece of code, only add yours
- **Do not** edit any of the other files
- **Uncomment** line 3 if you solved the bonus question

<br/>

## How to run tests?

You _can_ test your code on your own in the `Exercise.js` file.

**But**, to pass the task you should also pass the **automated tests**. You should have 6/6 (you start with 1/6 because of the bonus)

To run the tests type `npm test` and press enter.

# The Questions

### Question 1

Write a JavaScript function that reverse a string.

`Example x = "Cyber4s;`

`Expected Output : s4rebyC`
<br/>
<br/>

### Question 2

Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.

`Example string : 'dog'`

`Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g`
<br/>
<br/>

### Question 3

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.

`Example string : 'the quick brown fox'`

`Expected Output : 'The Quick Brown Fox '`
<br/>
<br/>

### Question 4

Write a JavaScript function to compute the value of x^n where n is the exponent and x is the bases.
<br/>
<br/>

### Question 5

Write a JavaScript function to find the first not repeated character.

`Sample arguments : 'abacddbec'`

`Expected output : 'e'`
<br/>
<br/>

### Question 6 - Bonus

Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.

According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper

positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum.

Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next

perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
